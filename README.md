## Hi there, I'm Alexandra!👋
*(Friends called me Alex)*

I’m an applied math grad who fell in love with data—especially when it solves real-world problems. My happy place? **Finding patterns in chaos, building ML models, and making slick visualizations** that actually make sense to people.

### 🔧 **Tech Toolkit**
- **Coding**: **`Python`** (Pandas, Scikit-learn), **`R`** (Tidyverse), **`SQL`**
- **Viz**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, ggplot2 (*because pretty charts matter*)
- **Tools**: Excel (*yes, it still rules*), Jupyter, RStudio

###🚀 **What I’m Into**
- **Finance + Data Science:** Quant models, risk analysis, and anything where numbers meet strategy.
- **Machine Learning:** From regression to neural nets—if it predicts things, I’m game.
- **Data Storytelling:** Because no one cares about your insights if they’re buried in a spreadsheet.

### 🎵 **When I’m Not Coding…**
- **Singing in choirs** 🎤 (and occasionally winning competitions 🏆).
- **Taking photos** 📸 (*someday I’ll link that portfolio… maybe*).
